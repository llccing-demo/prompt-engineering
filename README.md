**Limitations**

- Control
- Complex tasks
- Specialized domain
- Long-form text


### Few-shot Prompting

Few-shot prompting is a technique in which a model is trained to perform a specific task with limited or few training examples, also called shots, typically in the range of 1–10.


The difference between zore-shot and few-shot is that, for zero-shot, no examples just question. but for few-shot, the query includes some examples let model understand.

**Limitations**

- Generalization
- Task complexity
- Limited exploration
- Lack of contextual understanding

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

the chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting technique enables the model to demonstrate complex reasoning capabilities through intermediate reasoning steps.

key words:
