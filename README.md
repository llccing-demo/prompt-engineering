# All You need to konw about Prompt Engineering

## Prompt Engineering Overview

Prompt engineering is the process of designing effective prompts for generative AI models.

### Types of Prompts

- Text summarization
- Information extration
- Question and answers
- Text classification
- Translation
- Code generation
- Reasoning

### Prompt elements

- Instruction
- Context
- Constraints
- Format

### Prompt Engineering Best Practices

The priciples

- Simplicity
- Specificity
- Essential prompt keywords

Limitations

- Citing references 列举引用
- Solving math problems
- Hallucination 幻觉


### Role Prompting

Examples of role

- Fiction writer
- Poet
- Motivational speaker
- Customer and support


## Techniques of Prompting

### Zero-shot Prompting

Zero-shot prompting is a prompting technique that involves generating text without any training on the specific task at hand.


**Limitations**

- Control
- Complex tasks
- Specialized domain
- Long-form text


### Few-shot Prompting

Few-shot prompting is a technique in which a model is trained to perform a specific task with limited or few training examples, also called shots, typically in the range of 1–10.


The difference between zore-shot and few-shot is that, for zero-shot, no examples just question. but for few-shot, the query includes some examples let model understand.

**Limitations**

- Generalization
- Task complexity
- Limited exploration
- Lack of contextual understanding

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

the chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting technique enables the model to demonstrate complex reasoning capabilities through intermediate reasoning steps.

key words:

Let's think step by step.

Examples:

- Arithmetic reasoning
- Common sense reasoning
